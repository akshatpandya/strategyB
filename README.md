strategy B for IARC 2017

What this strategy does is:

1) The quad starts from the red line and goes to around 6m from there.
2) Then it hovers there until it see a groundbot.
3) Once it sees a groundbot it changes it's direction towards the green line.
4) The it flies to the mid line and starts a greedy approach from there.
5) It hovers and moves ahead 1m everytime until it finds a groundbot.
6) Once it finds a ground bot it locks on it and always hovers above it and do the necessary taps to move it out of the green line.
7) Then it repeats the same greedy approach from the green line.
